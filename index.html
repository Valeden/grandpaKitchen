                This is 73 year old Narayana Reddy, colloquially known as Grandpa. He, alongside his grandson Shrikant Reddy and 2 other men, cook massive meals twice a week for hungry orphans in Telangana, India. Videoes of their work are uploaded to their Youtube channel, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC1of9ELYwB623fWaAMRDVFA">Grandpa Kitchen</a>. In these heartwarming videos, Grandpa and the others cook in an open area surrounded by nature. The cooking videoes are instructive, with Grandpa saying what steps are next and listing off ingredients as he uses them. Once the meals are complete however, the 4 men hand them out to those who are hungry. While sometimes the recipients of these meals are adults, most of the time it's the children at a local orphanage. Not much is known about these men but there is one thing for certain, they're helping those in need.

                As of 2018 there are nearly 30 million orphaned children in India. As of 2019 there are over 195 million people in India that are malnourished. Grandpa and his helpers do good for their part of India, but there are many other places that are not fortunate enough to have the same amount of support from good people like them.
                If you would like to make a difference, the same way Grandpa has, I encourage you to donate to either 
                <a href="https://www.savethechildren.in/">Save The Children</a> or the <a href="https://www.indiafoodbanking.org/">Indian Foodbanking Network</a>. 
                Both of these non-profit organizations do good work and giving them money to get it done is a quick and easy way for you to help. If you would like to support Grandpa directly, they do have a <a href="https://www.patreon.com/grandpakitchen">Patreon</a> page you can support as well.
